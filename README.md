Opinion Formation with Economic Utility
This is sample code used for my undergraduate thesis: "The Dynamics of Opinion Formation: A Utility Function-Infused Market-Based Model‚Äù.
The code is a simple variation of the 'DeGroot' opinion formation model, modelling the dynamics with matrices; with an infusion of utility.
